An Asteroids clone.

Initially started as I was following the tutorial on making the core logic for asteroids "Let's Create: Asteroids in Unity" by the youtube channel Firnox.

I nearly immediately deviated from their design and developed practically all the code from scratch.

Features basic custom asteroid and ship graphics

basic large asteroid shattering mechanic to replace the classic games spawning of smaller versions of the asteroid.
